# Set Up Continuous Deployment For create-react-app & netlify

Netlify has a feature where you can configure every push to the `main` branch on GitHub to trigger a new build/update on Netlify.

## Getting Started

- Go to GitHub and create a new public repository.
- In your `create-react-app` add the new GitHub remote link.
- Confirm your `create-react-app` code is now on GitHub.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure your application runs locally. If it does not run locally, there is no hope of it working on deployment.

**IMPORTANT:** With continuous deployment, you only want working code to be on `main`, use branches like `dev` to build and confirm a working app before merging into `main`.

**IMPORTANT:** Deploy early and often. The best time to deploy is right after you run `create-react-app` - the less code you have written, the less work it will take to debug each deployment, in case there is an issue. 

## Netlify Settings

See the status of your deployment. Click on it to see more details.

Check the logs. It is good to get familiar with what is there. When errors occur with the build, this is where you would go to debug.

Check for the line `Site is live âœ¨` to confirm your site is live.

Go to the `Deploys` tab and you can then click on the link to see your site live. You can also share this link with your friends and family!

In order to continue to update your Netlify live site:

- On the `main` branch, confirm that your app works. While working on your app, be sure to work on another branch like `dev` and then only merge into `main` when your new features are working.
- Add, commit, and push your code to main.
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "New feature added"
   git push origin main
   ```
- Give your site a few minutes to build.
- Be sure to check the dashboard and live site to make sure everything is working right.
