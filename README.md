# Set Up Continuous Deployment For create-react-app & netlify

Netlify has a feature where you can configure every push to the `main` branch on GitHub to trigger a new build/update on Netlify.

## Getting Started

- Go to GitHub and create a new repository (use public so instructors can check your work)
- In your `create-react-app` add the new GitHub remote link
- Confirm your `create-react-app` is now on GitHub

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure your app runs locally. If it does not run locally, there is no hope of it working on deployment.

**IMPORTANT:** With continuous deployment, you only want working code to be on `main`, use branches like `dev` to build and confirm a working app before merging into `main`.

Check the logs, it is good to get familiar with what is there. When errors occur with the build, this is where you would go to debug.
